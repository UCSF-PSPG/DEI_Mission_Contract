**PSPG DEI Mission Statement**

The PSPG DEI committee was formed in 2020 during the resurgence of the
Black Lives Matter Movement precipitated by the killings of George Floyd
and Breonna Taylor, among other Black Americans, by the hands of police
officers. In light of these events, PSPG began recognizing the urgency
of addressing systemic racism within the program as evidenced by the
underrepresentation, particularly of Black individuals, at the student
and faculty level. To address these issues and build a more diverse,
equitable, and inclusive PSPG program, all members of our community are
asked to adopt the following mission statement.

> As a member of the PSPG Graduate Program, I am committed to respecting
> and supporting the individuality of each current and prospective
> community member. I affirm UCSF's PRIDE values and Principles of
> Community, which are the cornerstone for everything we do and unite
> our faculty, students, researchers, caregivers, and staff in building
> a culture of collaboration that inspires us to be our best today, and
> in the future. I commit to identifying and dismantling prejudicial
> systems by enacting practices supporting our values of diversity,
> equity, and inclusion (DEI).
>
> **Diversity:** To appreciate and celebrate differences in others
>
> **Equity:** To provide equal opportunities for all community members
> to reach their full potential
>
> **Inclusion:** To cultivate a safe environment where people of
> different identities feel welcomed and valued
>
> With my signature, I affirm these values, commit to upholding them,
> and promise to actively participate in a *minimum* of one DEI event or
> ongoing DEI role in the program per year, that will be tracked on the
> PSPG website.
